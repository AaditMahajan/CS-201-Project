# CS-201-Project

In this we have implemented in total five techniques for pattern searching in a text file namely :
1. Trie
2. Suffix Tree
3. KMP Algorithm
4. Finite Automata Algorithm
5. Aho-Corasick Algorithm

Due to high space complexity of Tries and Suffix Trees (O(n^2)), they are run on smaller text file named "sherlock2.txt".
Rest other techniques are used on a larger text file named "sherlock.txt".

Throughout all these techniques, we have kept the input-output of similar form. Each program requires you to enter the pattern to be searched and the output is basically the line in which pattern is found and the index of the starting character of the pattern in that line.
